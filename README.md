## Install/Update

### Install

1. Go to the [release page](https://github.com/EmmittJ/PoESkillTree/releases) and select the version you would like, most likely the latest.
2. Download
  1. Portal: choose the zip file
  2. Installer: choose the exe file
3. Unzip/Install it to a location of your choice
4. Start PoESkillTree.exe

### Update

**Automatic**

Go to: ```Help -> Check for Updates```

**Manually**

If you have settings and/or saved builds you want to keep when updating do this:

1. Follow the first three steps under *Install*
2. Now either unzip to same directory and overwrite everything. Or choose a new location and then copy over PersistentData.xml. To copy your saved builds, follow [this wiki page](https://github.com/EmmittJ/PoESkillTree/wiki/How-To:-Copy-Builds).

### Skilltree version

The program always ships with the latest skilltree data available when the release is done. If you know there is a new version of the tree on the official website but no new version of this program is available you can do this:

1. Delete the Data folder and then just start the program, it will download the latest version.
2. If you have the program running just go to: ```Tools -> Redownload Skill Tree Assets```

Note: Both these options require that you can access the official Path of Exile website.
